                <p>
                    The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) is a film that follows Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloweentown, as he grows tired of the life he currently lives. Along with town members, he is responsible for bringing fright to the world through Halloween. As he roams the forest, reflecting on his life, he stumbles upon Christmastown. With its lights and small toys, Jack becomes enchanted and looks to take control of Christmas. Throughout the film, we watch as Halloweentown prepares for Christmas by creating toys and a sled with reindeer on top of kidnapping Santa Claus. In the end, Jack recognizes that he had taken his life for granted and shows a new-found appreciation for life and those around him.

                    Those who appreciate Tim Burton's style of work certainly know of The Addams Family.

This series is expected to air on the popular streaming site Netflix sometime in 2022, so keep an eye out!
